Consequently, the temporal resolution of wind forcing is an important factor to consider for river plume simulations. This study evaluates river plume simulation errors caused by temporal subsampling of wind forcing data. We use an idealized model of a river plume over a continental shelf and force the model with temporally filtered winds to quantify the effect of temporal subsampling on simulation accuracy. The simulation error is proportional to the fraction of energy missing in the high-frequency wind absent from the forcing. These results set requirements for temporal wind resolution in realistic simulations of river plumes. Spectral analysis of observed wind records at the Mississippi River, Columbia River, and Merrimack River regions indicates that, for simulation errors due to insufficient temporal wind resolution to be smaller than 5 percent of the variance, 3-hourly or 4-hourly wind data are reasonable. Though horizontal variations in wind forcing are lost, analyzing FFT spectrum of a single-point wind measurement in the simulation region is helpful for estimating simulation errors due to temporal resolution, and hence aid in properly selecting temporal resolutions.","tags":null,"title":"Temporal resolution of wind forcing required for river plume simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Lixin Qu**","Robert Hetland","Leif Thomas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543212000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543212000,"objectID":"53263062c3a34c0753c4c0650c14e2e3","permalink":"https://LixinQu.github.io/talk/ocng/","publishdate":"2018-11-26T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ocng/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Internal-wave-driven mixing within submesoscale eddies","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Lixin Qu**","Robert Hetland","Leif Thomas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543212000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543212000,"objectID":"3e05b97669aa5b18e5a89984fd9e9ec6","permalink":"https://LixinQu.github.io/talk/pecs/","publishdate":"2018-11-26T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/pecs/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Near-inertial waves at submesoscale coherent vortices in a buoyancy-driven flow","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Lixin Qu**","Xiaopei Lin\u003csup\u003e*\u003c/sup\u003e","Robert D Hetland","Jingsong Guo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514786400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514786400,"objectID":"4dda96efddee00299d04c945f55e85bd","permalink":"https://LixinQu.github.io/publication/qu-2018-asymmetric/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/qu-2018-asymmetric/","section":"publication","summary":"The primary goal of this study is to investigate the asymmetric structure of continental shelf wave in a semienclosed double‐shelf basin, such as the Yellow Sea. Supported by in situ observations and realistic numerical simulations, it is found that in the Yellow Sea, the shelf wave response to the synoptic wind forcing does not match the mathematically symmetric solution of classic double‐shelf wave theory, but rather exhibits a westward shift. To study the formation mechanism of this asymmetric structure, an idealized model was used and two sets of experiments were conducted. The results confirm that the asymmetric structure is due to the existence of a topographic waveguide connecting both shelves. For a semienclosed basin, such as the Yellow Sea, a connection at the end of the basin eliminates the potential vorticity barrier between the two shelves and hence plays a role as a connecting waveguide for shelf waves. This waveguide enables the shelf wave to propagate from one shelf to the other shelf and produces the asymmetric response in sea level and upwind flow evolutions.","tags":null,"title":"The asymmetric continental shelf wave in response to the synoptic wind burst in a semienclosed double-shelf basin","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Texas-Louisiana shelf in the northern Gulf of Mexico is an ideal, geophysical lab to study near-inertial waves (NIWs) within submesoscale vortices.

However, the global pattern of wind stress implies that the wind stress curl at the latitudes of the Kuroshio Current region decreases during the past 30 years. This contrasts to the classical Island Rule theory, which predicts that the transport of the Kuroshio Current should be proportional to the wind stress curl at the latitudes of this region. This study attempts to address this discrepancy by adapting the classical theory to the scenario with a continental shelf slope around an island. Numerical experiments based on a barotropic model are also conducted to investigate the dynamical mechanism. The primary finding is that the wind stress curl at the higher latitudes controls the transport around the island rather than the one at the same latitudes as demonstrated in the classical theory. The physical mechanism is dealing with the propagation of Rossby waves. The waveguide of the Rossby waves is modified by the topographic beta effect of the shelf such that the modulating signals are in fact coming from the higher latitudes than the island region. Consequently, the transport around an island is regulated by the wind at higher latitudes in the scenario with a continental shelf around the island.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of the continental shelf slope around island on the Island Rule","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Lixin Qu**\u003csup\u003e*\u003c/sup\u003e"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1398920400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1398920400,"objectID":"d28c0708d0fd64a8b079b5932afa7253","permalink":"https://LixinQu.github.io/publication/qu-2014-master/","publishdate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/qu-2014-master/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Study of the oceanic response to winter strong wind events in the Yellow and Bohai Sea","type":"publication"}]
